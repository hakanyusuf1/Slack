# Slack

Check out my new project!

This website is a clone of Slack, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It has features such as creating and joining channels, sending messages, uploading files, and a dashboard for managing channels and user profiles. It also has a search feature for finding specific channels and messages. The website provides a similar user experience to the original Slack platform.
